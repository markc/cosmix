# cosmix-comp

`cosmix-comp` is the Wayland compositor used by the Cosmix desktop. It can run
nested inside an existing Wayland session with `cosmix-comp --nested`, or use
the KMS backend on a system seat.

## Supported Wayland protocols

The compositor advertises the core compositor, subcompositor, seat, output,
shared-memory, DMA-BUF, explicit synchronisation, viewporter, fractional-scale,
presentation-time, XDG shell and XDG decoration globals needed by its desktop
clients.

| Protocol | Version | Current support |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `zwlr_layer_shell_v1` | 4 | Layer surfaces and layer popups map, arrange and configure through Smithay's `LayerMap`; protocol strata, keyboard interactivity, input regions and exclusive usable-area effects are supported. |
| `ext_idle_notifier_v1` | 2 | Per-seat notifications use Smithay's calloop timers; real pointer, keyboard, touch, pointer-gesture and tablet-tool activity resets the timeout and resumes an idle notification. Device-removal reconciliation does not count as activity. |
| `ext_foreign_toplevel_list_v1` | 1 | Mapped XDG toplevels expose stable mapping identifiers, title and app ID updates; unmap or destruction closes the handle, and late clients receive the current mapped set. |

Layer surfaces stack in the protocol order: Background, Bottom, normal XDG
toplevels and popups, Top, then Overlay. Raising a surface changes its order
only within its stratum. A layer popup stays in its parent's stratum, including
when the parent changes layer.

`keyboard_interactivity=None` layers receive pointer and touch input but never
take keyboard focus or raise; their popups can use pointer/touch grabs but not a
keyboard grab. `OnDemand` layers take focus on a pointer press or first touch.
The highest stacked mapped `Exclusive` layer latches keyboard focus until it
unmaps, is destroyed, or commits a non-Exclusive policy. Normal-window clicks
may still raise their window while that latch is active. Installing or
transferring an Exclusive latch, changing interactivity, or otherwise moving
keyboard focus dismisses any active XDG popup keyboard grab before the arbiter
sets its chosen focus. While an Exclusive latch is held, an unrelated popup
grab request is denied with `popup_done`, because xdg-shell requires the
topmost grabbing popup to own keyboard focus; a popup belonging to the latched
layer may grab normally. When a focused layer stops being eligible, focus
moves to the next Exclusive layer, otherwise to the highest visible normal
toplevel, or to no surface when neither exists. Keyboard focus inside an
Exclusive layer's own active popup grab satisfies the layer's latch: ordinary
panel redraws neither pull focus back to the layer root nor dismiss its menu.

Committed `wl_surface` input regions participate in hit testing for every
surface role. An empty region makes a panel click-through, and regions are
clipped to the surface's presented buffer bounds. A committed region change,
map or unmap retargets a stationary pointer after its complete Smithay surface
transaction applies. Committed stack-band, subsurface-order and LayerMap
geometry changes use the same retargeting path. Synchronized descendants
therefore produce one atomic leave/enter transition and one hit test for the
transaction, never intermediate targets from partially applied sibling state.
If rearrangement moves the currently focused surface without changing its
identity, the compositor sends one motion with the corrected surface-local
coordinates. Output resize and KMS topology changes batch layer arrangement,
usable-area derivation and window clamping before that single reconciliation.
Up to 256 region operations are retained exactly; larger regions use their
added rectangles' bounding box so protocol-thread hit testing stays bounded.

Exclusive zones reduce the usable output rectangle. New-window cascade
origins, maximised sizes and normal restore clamping all use that rectangle and
are recalculated after layer map, unmap or destruction and after output size or
KMS topology changes. Layers are arranged before maximised windows are
reconfigured, so their wire configure uses the current usable rectangle.

Layer shell honours the requested output, including an explicit
`wl_output`. A request with no output uses the backend's default output; if no
output exists, the layer surface is closed and is never mapped.

## Vendored changes

The vendored Smithay layer-surface handle has an additive `reset_after_unmap`
helper so the compositor can clear Smithay's private configure queue while
applying layer-shell's protocol-mandated post-unmap state reset. Smithay's
`CompositorHandler` also has an additive `transaction_applied` callback so
pointer hit testing can observe one complete synchronized-surface transaction
instead of each surface's intermediate state. Its pointer handle has one
additive no-focus-restore grab teardown used when a grabbed surface disappears
inside that transaction, preventing stale cached focus from being replayed
before the final hit test.
Smithay's foreign-toplevel list has one additive constructor accepting a
compositor-provided identifier. This lets the identifier include Cosmix's
surface identity, mapping generation and an unpredictable per-compositor
instance nonce while protocol dispatch and replay remain entirely delegated
to Smithay.
